## What to Expect in a C# Coding Interview

C# coding interviews typically involve a mix of theoretical questions and practical coding exercises. Be prepared to discuss:

*   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles:** Explain concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. Be ready to provide examples of how you've used these principles in your projects.
*   **Data Structures and Algorithms:** Demonstrate your knowledge of common data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, and hash tables. Be prepared to implement algorithms such as sorting, searching, and graph traversal.
*   **.NET Framework Concepts:** Understand the .NET Framework architecture, including the Common Language Runtime (CLR), Common Type System (CTS), and Base Class Library (BCL).
*   **Design Patterns:** Familiarize yourself with common design patterns like Singleton, Factory, Observer, and Decorator. Be able to explain their purpose and how they can be used to solve design problems.
*   **Concurrency and Multithreading:** Understand how to create and manage threads, synchronize access to shared resources, and handle potential issues like race conditions and deadlocks.
*   **Database Access:** Be prepared to write queries using LINQ or ADO.NET to retrieve and manipulate data from databases.
*   **Error Handling:** Understand how to use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and prevent application crashes.
*   **Unit Testing:** Familiarize yourself with unit testing frameworks like NUnit or MSTest and be prepared to write unit tests for your code.

## Key C# Concepts Frequently Tested

Several core C# concepts are consistently tested in coding interviews. Ensuring you have a strong grasp of these areas is crucial:

*   **Delegates and Events:** Understand how to use delegates and events to implement event-driven programming. Be prepared to explain the difference between multicast and unicast delegates.
*   **LINQ (Language Integrated Query):** Be proficient in using LINQ to query data from various sources, including collections, databases, and XML files.
*   **Asynchronous Programming (Async/Await):** Understand how to use async and await keywords to write asynchronous code that doesn't block the main thread.
*   **Generics:** Be able to use generics to create reusable code that can work with different data types.
*   **Reflection:** Understand how to use reflection to inspect and manipulate types at runtime.
*   **Attributes:** Be able to define and use custom attributes to add metadata to your code.
*   **Garbage Collection:** Understand how the .NET garbage collector works and how to optimize your code to minimize memory usage.
*   **Value Types vs. Reference Types:** Know the difference between value types and reference types and how they are stored in memory.

## Sample C# Interview Questions (and how the Udemy Course Helps)

The Udemy course available for free download covers these types of questions (with solutions). It is divided into sections based on difficulty level.

*   **Basic:**
    *   What is the difference between `==` and `.Equals()` in C#? (The course explains value vs reference equality in detail)
    *   Explain the concept of boxing and unboxing. (The course includes diagrams to clarify the process.)
    *   What are the different access modifiers in C#? (The course provides real-world examples of each modifier.)
*   **Intermediate:**
    *   Implement a function to reverse a string in C#. (The course walks through various algorithms for string reversal).
    *   Explain the difference between an interface and an abstract class. (The course covers the SOLID principles, including interface segregation and dependency inversion.)
    *   Write a C# program to find the largest element in an array. (The course covers various sorting and searching algorithms.)
*   **Advanced:**
    *   Explain the concept of dependency injection and how it can be implemented in C#. (The course uses a practical example with a C# DI framework.)
    *   Design a class that implements the Singleton pattern. (The course presents various thread-safe implementations of the Singleton pattern).
    *   How would you handle concurrency issues when accessing a shared resource from multiple threads? (The course explores locking mechanisms and thread synchronization techniques.)

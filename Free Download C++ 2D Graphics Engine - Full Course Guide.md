*   **Career Advancement:** Employers highly value developers with experience in low-level graphics programming and engine architecture. Having a personal graphics engine project in your portfolio can significantly enhance your career prospects in the game development industry.

This free course dives into the core aspects of building a 2D graphics engine. You will learn to:

*   Set up a development environment with necessary libraries (SDL, OpenGL).
*   Implement a basic rendering pipeline.
*   Load and display images/textures.
*   Handle user input.
*   Create animations and special effects.

## Course Structure and Modules

This **free C++ 2D Graphics Engine course** is structured to guide you through the entire process, from setting up your development environment to implementing advanced features. Here’s a detailed overview of the modules:

1.  **Introduction and Setup:** This module covers the fundamentals of C++ programming relevant to graphics development and guides you through setting up your development environment. It includes installing necessary libraries like **SDL** (Simple DirectMedia Layer) and **OpenGL**, which provide low-level access to graphics hardware. You'll also learn about the basic concepts of window creation, event handling, and rendering contexts.

2.  **Rendering Basics:** In this module, you'll dive into the core concepts of rendering, including **pixel manipulation**, **coordinate systems**, and **drawing primitives** (lines, rectangles, and triangles). You'll learn how to clear the screen, set pixel colors, and draw basic shapes using OpenGL.

3.  **Texture Management:** This module covers the essential techniques for loading, storing, and displaying images in your engine. You'll learn how to load images from various file formats (PNG, JPEG) using libraries like **SDL_image** and how to create OpenGL textures from these images. You’ll also explore techniques for **texture filtering** and **texture mapping** to improve the visual quality of your graphics.

4.  **Sprite Animation:** This module delves into the techniques for animating sprites, which are essential for creating dynamic and engaging games. You'll learn how to create **sprite sheets** (images containing multiple frames of animation), how to extract individual frames from the sprite sheet, and how to display them in sequence to create animation effects. You'll also explore techniques for **animation blending** and **animation controllers** to create more complex and realistic animations.

5.  **Input Handling:** This module focuses on handling user input from the keyboard and mouse. You'll learn how to capture key presses and mouse clicks, how to map these inputs to game actions, and how to create a responsive and intuitive user interface.

6.  **Collision Detection:** This is critical for game logic. You'll learn about AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) collision and other common techniques.

7.  **Advanced Effects:** This module explores advanced graphics techniques such as **particle effects**, **lighting**, and **shadowing**. You'll learn how to create particle systems to simulate fire, smoke, and other visual effects.

## Why Use C++ for Web Scraping?

While Python often dominates the web scraping landscape, C++ offers distinct advantages, especially when performance is critical. Here's why you should consider learning C++ for your web scraping projects:

*   **Speed and Efficiency:** C++ is a compiled language, resulting in significantly faster execution speeds compared to interpreted languages like Python. This is crucial when dealing with large-scale scraping operations.
*   **Resource Management:** C++ provides fine-grained control over memory management, allowing you to optimize resource usage and prevent memory leaks, particularly important when scraping resource-intensive websites.
*   **Scalability:** C++ is well-suited for building scalable web scraping applications that can handle a high volume of requests and data processing.
*   **Integration with Existing Systems:** If your organization already has a codebase in C++, integrating web scraping functionality becomes seamless.
*   **Lower Memory Footprint:** C++ applications generally have a lower memory footprint than their Python counterparts, allowing you to run more scraping processes concurrently on the same hardware.

This free C++ web scraping course covers:

✔ **Fundamentals of C++:** A quick refresher on the essential C++ concepts required for web scraping, even if you're new to the language.
✔ **HTTP Requests and Responses:** Understanding how to make HTTP requests and interpret server responses using C++ libraries.
✔ **HTML Parsing with Libraries like Beautiful Soup (C++ Port):** Learning to navigate and extract data from HTML documents. Although the original BeautifulSoup is Python based, this course shows you how to use similar libraries that have been ported to C++.
✔ **CSS Selectors and XPath:** Mastering the art of selecting specific elements from web pages using CSS selectors and XPath expressions.
✔ **Data Storage and Processing:** Storing the scraped data in various formats (CSV, JSON, databases) and processing it using C++ algorithms.
✔ **Handling Dynamic Content (JavaScript Rendering):** Techniques for scraping websites that rely heavily on JavaScript to load content, using libraries that provide headless browser capabilities.
✔ **Best Practices for Ethical Web Scraping:** Adhering to robots.txt rules, respecting website terms of service, and implementing polite scraping techniques.
✔ **Anti-Scraping Measures and Mitigation:** Understanding common anti-scraping techniques employed by websites and learning how to circumvent them ethically.

*   Using Gumbo, a C++ HTML5 parsing library, to parse HTML documents and create a DOM tree.
*   Navigating the DOM tree to locate specific elements using CSS selectors and XPath expressions.
*   Extracting data from HTML elements, including text, attributes, and links.

**Module 4: Advanced Web Scraping Techniques**

*   Handling pagination and scraping multiple pages of data.
*   Implementing rate limiting to avoid overloading websites and getting blocked.
*   Using proxies to rotate IP addresses and bypass IP-based blocking.
*   Dealing with CAPTCHAs and other anti-scraping measures.
*   Scraping websites that require authentication and login.

**Module 5: Scraping Dynamic Websites with JavaScript Rendering**

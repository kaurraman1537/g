## Understanding the C# Visitor Pattern

The Visitor Pattern provides a way to separate algorithms from the object structures they operate on. This separation promotes **maintainability, flexibility, and extensibility** in your C# code. It's a vital tool for any serious C# developer.

## Why Learn the Visitor Pattern?

*   **Increased Flexibility:** Add new operations to your object structure without modifying existing classes.
*   **Improved Maintainability:** Keep algorithms and object structures independent, simplifying updates and debugging.
*   **Enhanced Reusability:** Apply the same algorithm to different object structures using different visitor implementations.
*   **Decoupling:** Reduces dependencies between classes, leading to more modular and testable code.
*   **Following SOLID Principles:** The Visitor Pattern aligns with the Open/Closed Principle (open for extension, closed for modification).

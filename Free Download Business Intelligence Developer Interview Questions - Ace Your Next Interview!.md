### 1. Technical Skills Assessment

This is the core of the interview and focuses on your proficiency in various BI tools and technologies. Expect questions related to:

*   **Data Warehousing:** Concepts like schemas (star, snowflake), ETL processes, data modeling, and dimensional modeling.
*   **SQL:** Writing complex queries, optimizing performance, understanding database design principles.

*   **Data Analysis and Visualization:** Understanding different chart types, creating insightful visualizations, and interpreting data to identify trends and patterns.
*   **ETL Tools:** Experience with tools like Informatica, Talend, or SSIS for data extraction, transformation, and loading.
*   **Programming Languages:** Knowledge of programming languages like Python or R for data manipulation and analysis.

### 2. Behavioral Questions

These questions assess your soft skills, teamwork abilities, and how you handle challenging situations. Common examples include:

*   "Tell me about a time you had to overcome a challenging technical problem."
*   "Describe a project where you had to work with a team to achieve a common goal."
*   "How do you handle conflicting priorities and deadlines?"
*   "Explain a time you made a mistake and how you learned from it."

### 3. Scenario-Based Questions

These questions present you with real-world scenarios that BI developers often encounter. Your ability to analyze the situation, identify potential solutions, and articulate your reasoning will be evaluated. For instance:

*   "How would you approach designing a data warehouse for a specific business domain?"
*   "How would you troubleshoot a performance issue with a slow-running SQL query?"
*   "How would you design a dashboard to track key performance indicators (KPIs) for a sales team?"

### 4. Questions About Your Experience

Be prepared to discuss your previous projects, highlighting your contributions and the impact you made. Quantify your achievements whenever possible. For example, instead of saying "I improved dashboard performance," say "I improved dashboard performance by 20% by optimizing SQL queries."
